# Interactive Bézier Curve Visualizer

## Description

This Python script enables the interactive creation and visualization of Bézier curves. It utilizes `numpy` for numerical operations and `matplotlib` for plotting and interaction. Users can click on the plot to define the control points of the Bézier curve, and the script dynamically generates and displays the curve based on these points.

## Requirements

- Python
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To run this script, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

Run the script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python interacte-_Bézier-curve.py
```

Click on the plot area to define four control points for the Bézier curve. The script will automatically generate and plot the curve based on these points.

## Features

- Interactive plot area to select control points for the Bézier curve.
- Real-time visualization of Bézier curves.
- Easy-to-use interface for exploring curve shapes.
